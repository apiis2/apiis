* If you want to ask somebody to help you with your code, be polite and make
  shure you have these two lines at the beginning of your script, module, code
  snippet:

     use strict;
     use warnings;

  If you don't use strict and warnings, don't ask anybody.

* Don't use Tabs. Make your editor replace them with blanks.

* Use 4 blanks for indentation per level.

* Use perltidy to format your code.
  Copy the perltidyrc from this directory to /etc/perltidyrc or ~/.perltidyrc.
  The configuration is based on the excellent book:
     Damian Conway -- Perl Best Practices
     O'Reilly (available in english and german)

* Use perlcritic to check your code.
  perlcritic is a Perl module from CPAN. For Debian run:

     apt-get install libperl-critic-perl \
                     libset-scalar-perl \
                     libppi-perl \
                     libtest-object-perl

  You might want to include this line into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

     deb http://forssa.tzv.fal.de/debian-apiis-perl/ ./

  Then run 'perlcritic <perlfiles>'. It tells you where you can enhance your
  code.

* If you don't like these guidelines or want to add more, let's discuss them on
  the mailing list apiis@tzv.fal.de
