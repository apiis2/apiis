\chapter{Introduction}
In APIIS we define three groups of people working with the system. These
are:
\begin{description}
   \item[developers]the guys (and may be gals) developing the routines
   usually hidden from those people implementing a system
   \item[implementors]people who use the tools box to setup a running
   system, which pertains to a particular set of conditions. This may be
   the cattle population in one country
   \item[users]these are the people who in the end use the system
\end{description}
Clearly, we may sometime find persons who are both implementors and users. 

The developer's documentation covers all software  that is hidden from the
implementors. This means we are talking about the deep and sometimes dark
vaults and sometimes even dungeons of APIIS.

You may be surprised by the section "Undocumented subroutines". Currently,
   the meta layer of APIIS is being rewritten to an object oriented mode. 
   In this process, each routine that is handled will get its own
   documentation section in the Perl code. The subroutines listed here are
   of the non OO kind and will therefore have to converted/replaced by the
   developers. Thus, this chapter serves more like a reminder for them to
   get its length towards zero.
