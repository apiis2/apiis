\chapter{Synchronization of Database Content}
\section{Database structure}

Here are described all elements of the database structure that are
related or dedicated to the synchronization process.


\subsection{Additional fields}

In each table there are three meta-fields that are related to the
synchronization: \textbf{{}``guid}'', \textbf{{}``owner''} and
\textbf{{}``version''}. These fields are set automatically by the
system and contain respectively the unique record number, the record
owner (i.e. in EFABIS this is the node name) and the record version
number. 

There is also an {}``ordinary'' boolean field in each table called
{}``\textbf{synch}'', that is set by user and that determines if
the record is targeted for synchronization. This field is required,
because there is no generic way to distinguish between records from
one and the same table, that have to be synchronized and that do not.


\subsection{Additional tables}

There are three {}``system'' tables used explicitly for synchronization
purposes: {}``\textbf{nodes}'', {}``\textbf{sources}'' and {}``\textbf{targets}''.
These tables describe all nodes in the system and the data flow from
one node to another.

\begin{itemize}
\item nodes - contains all node names and IP addresses
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE nodes (
   guid              int4,       -- global identifier
   nodename          text,       -- node name
   address           text,       -- node ip address
   last_change_dt    timestamp,  -- Date of last change, automatic timestamp
   last_change_user  text,       -- User who did the last change
   dirty             bool,       -- report errors from check_integrity
   chk_lvl           int2,       -- check level
   owner             text,       -- record class
   version           int4,       -- version
   synch             bool        -- is record targeted for synchronization
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uidx_nodes_1 ON nodes ( guid );
\end{verbatim} 
\item sources - contains information about the data elements this node
expects from the others
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE sources (
   guid              int4,       -- global identifier
   source            text,       -- source node
   tablename         text,       -- table name
   class             text,       -- owner node
   columnnames       text,       -- columns
   last_change_dt    timestamp,  -- Date of last change, automatic timestamp
   last_change_user  text,       -- User who did the last change
   dirty             bool,       -- report errors from check_integrity
   chk_lvl           int2,       -- check level
   owner             text,       -- record class
   version           int4,       -- version
   synch             bool        -- is record targeted for synchronization
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uidx_sources_1 ON sources ( guid );
\end{verbatim} 
\item targets - contains information about the data elements this node distributes
to others
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE targets (
   guid              int4,       -- global identifier
   target            text,       -- target node
   tablename         text,       -- table name
   class             text,       -- owner node
   columnnames       text,       -- columns
   last_change_dt    timestamp,  -- Date of last change, automatic timestamp
   last_change_user  text,       -- User who did the last change
   dirty             bool,       -- report errors from check_integrity
   chk_lvl           int2,       -- check level
   owner             text,       -- record class
   version           int4,       -- version
   synch             bool        -- is record targeted for synchronization
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uidx_targets_1 ON targets ( guid );
\end{verbatim} 
\end{itemize}
