\chapter{Introduction}

This paper represents the documentation of APIIS. It tries to explain
all steps required to setup and run an information system. This will
be done using one reference database for breeding programs and is
available as a module (ref\_breedprg) in the CVS tree. It resides
in \$APIIS\_HOME/ref\_breedprg. Other modules come soon, for example
for manage the datas from molecular laboratories or for cryo conservation
systems. 

The directory initial\index{initial} contains all data and programs
required to load the historic data. The batch job runall\index{runall}
should be sufficient to execute the complete procedure for creating
the database and loading the historic data sets. There are two further
runall jobs, runall\_cleaning\_and\_LO.pl to demonstrate the handling
of load objects and the error handling, and runall\_output.pl to show
some outputs from the database.
