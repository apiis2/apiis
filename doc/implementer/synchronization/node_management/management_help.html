<H1><A NAME="introduction">
1 Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
The node management system is written as a frontend of the synchronization
process in APIIS-based network. This network consist of APIIS servers
called nodes. Each node has unique name and IP address. This information is stored 
in the database of each node in table "nodes". How to manage this table you will find 
<A href="#managing_nodes">here</A>. The next step is to determine the data elements - 
what information you receive and what information you supply to the other nodes. This is done 
by managing  tables <A href="#managing_sources">sources</A> and <A href="#managing_targets">targets</A>.
Usually this these setting are done in the beginning when a node is established and only occasional 
changes may oocure at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
The synchronization process is client-server type. On the source node server daemon is listening for
incoming connections. The initiator of such a connection is the target mode where the client is started.
So if you want to give the others the opportunity to get your data you have to start the server daemon on 
your node. How to start/stop the server you can find <A href="#managing_server">here</A>.<br>
If you want to get data from other nodes then you have to start the client or simply 
<A href="#how_to_start">start the synchronization</A>(and hope that the other side is running the server)

</P>

<H1><A NAME="how_to_start">
2 How to start the synchronization</A>
</H1>


The synchronization process is maintained via the main window:


<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="synch.jpg"
 ALT="Image synch.jpg">
</DIV>


First you have to choose the server node from the drop-down list <B>Synchronize
with node.</B> Then from the menu bar choose: <B>Synchronization&gt;Start.</B>
Then you can monitor the process via the progress bar and the <B>System
information</B> field.



<H1><A NAME="managing_nodes">
3 Managing nodes information</A>
</H1>


To open the nodes namagement window choose from the menu bar <B>Settings&gt;Nodes.</B>
The window should look like this:


<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="nodes.jpg"
 ALT="Image nodes.jpg">
</DIV>


The list on the left side containes the names and IP addresses of
all nodes in the network.



<H2><A NAME="adding_node">
3.1 Adding new node</A>
</H2>


To add new node click the <B>New</B> button and enter node name and node
IP address in the responding fields. To save the information to the
database click the <B>Save</B>  button.



<H2><A NAME="editing_node">
3.2 Editing node </A>
</H2>


To edit the information about certain node first select the node from
the list. Then you will see the node name and the IP address also
in the text fields where you can edit the information. To save the
changes click <B>Save</B>.



<H2><A NAME="deleting_node">
3.3 Deleting node</A>
</H2>


To delete a node simply select it from the list and click the <B>Delete</B> button.



<H1><A NAME="managing_sources">
4 Managing sources information</A>
</H1>

To describe what information you want to receive from the others you have to start 
<B>Settings&gt;Sources</B>. 
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="sources.jpg"
 ALT="Image sources.jpg">
</DIV>
Then choose the source, the table name and the class of 
the records you want from the responding drop-down lists.
The classification of the records in EFABIS is made on the base of their ownership by respective country. Therefore the class list is 
very similar to the node list, so be careful.
<P>When the source, table and class are choosed you 
have to decide which columns from this table you want. You can select one or more column from 
the list on the right. To select multiply consecutive columns select the first one, then press and 
hold the <I>Shift</I> key and select the last one from the sequense you want. To select multiply 
non-consecutive columns - select the first, press and hold the <I>Control</I> key and select one 
by one the other columns. To deselect a column press and hold the <I>Control</I> key and click on
this column.
</P>
 <P>To store the changes click the <B>Update</B> button.</P>
<P>On the example above we want to receive from node EAAP from table breeds_horns the data from 
columns breed_id, creation_dt, creation_user, end_user, female, but only from those records that
are owned by Bulgaria.</P>

<H1><A NAME="managing_targets">
5 Managing targets information</A>
</H1>
The management of the information we supply to the other is similar to the one with the sources.
You have to start  <B>Settings&gt;Targets</B> and choose target node, table name, class and columns.
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="targets.jpg"
 ALT="Image targets.jpg">
</DIV>

On this example we will sent to EAAP the German data from the columns breed_id, creation_dt, creation_user, 
end_user, female in table breeds_horns. 

<H1><A NAME="managing_server">
6 Managing the server</A>
</H1>
Here you can start/stop the server daemon and verify the server status
<H2><A NAME="starting">
6.1 Starting</A>
</H2>
To start server daemon on the current node click <B>Server&gt;Start.</B>
<H2><A NAME="stopping">
6.2 Stopping</A>
</H2>
To stop click <B>Server&gt;Stop.</B>
<H2><A NAME="Status">
6.3 Status</A>
</H2>
To check the status of the server on the certain node you have to select the node from the drop-down list <B>Synchronize with node</B> and choose from the menu  <B>Server&gt;Ping.</B>
The status message will appear in <B>Server status</B> field. There are three possibilities:
<ul>
  <li> <B>FREE</B> - server is up and ready for synchronization </li>
  <li> <B>BUSY</B> - server is up, but is currently in synchronization with other client </li>
  <li> <B>Not responding</B> - client cannot establish connection with the server </li>
</ul>
