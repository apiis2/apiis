Additional font specification in a form file

MS Windows does not know about X fonts, therefore it is necessary to
specify fonts for other operating systems. There are two types of
font specifications:

1. Operating System Font: 
    All available fonts on the system are useable as long as you
    run the form in this Operating System. The disadvantage of this
    kind of specification is, the form file is not independent from
    the operating system.
    
    In the Unix X Window System you can get a list of Unix fonts
    by running the command:
            
                     xlsfonts
    
    Example to specify a X Window font:
       NORMALFONT=-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
    
       
    In MS Windows you can see the installed fonts: Click on the Start menu
    and select Settings -> Control Panel. Once the Control Panel appears,
    double-click Fonts.
    
    Example to specify a MS Windows font:
       NORMALFONT=Arial 12 normal
       LABELFONT={Times New Roman} 10 normal
       TITLEFONT={Arial Black} 24 bold
     (Note: for my installed Windows Tk version, it is necessary to specify
      the font name around with curly braces, if the name consist more
      then one word)


2. Operating System independent font specification:

    Syntax: xFONT=family,size,weight,slant,underline,overstrike

           x = TITLE | NORMAL | LABEL | BUTTON
    
    family: The family name can be courier, times, or helvetica.
            If you specify one of these, the closest match on your system
	    will be used.

      size: The amount specified for the font size indicates how big you
            want the font to be.
	    Positive values: font is sized in points.
	    Negative values: font is sized in pixel.

	    If a specified font size is not available on the system, the
	    system substitutes another font size, or even a different font
	    altogether.

    weight: normal | bold
            Determines the thickness of the font.

     slant: roman | italic
            roman means the font is upright.
	    italic will tilt the font to the right slightly.


 underline: 0 | 1
            If you want the characters to be underlined, specify 1.

overstrike: 0 | 1
            A line is drawn through the text when the value is 1.
    
    Examples:
       TITLEFONT=courier,18,bold,roman,0,0
       NORMALFONT=helvetica,8,normal,italic,0,0
       LABELFONT=times,12,bold,roman,1,0

    

In GENERAL section the parameters TITLEFONT, NORMALFONT, LABELFONT
and BUTTONFONT are now optional. It is not necessary to specify the fonts.
The default fonts are:

    TITLEFONT=helvetica,16,bold,roman,0,0
    NORMALFONT=helvetica,10,normal,roman,0,0
    LABELFONT=helvetica,10,bold,roman,0,0
    BUTTONFONT=helvetica,8,normal,roman,0,0
