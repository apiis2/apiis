Things to do:

* 10. Jun 1999:
  - Rebuild the reference database on base of the South African dataset
    (reduced to a handy size).
    [Frits]

  - Some methods need to be created:
    RangeF -> Create a Range function for the whole record, allowing legal
              Perl expressions as parameters.
              [Helmut, NN]
    LastAction

  - Write documentation for the already created code.
    Dito for the whole project.
    How is documentation of such a project done elsewhere?
    [all]

  - TkForms has a lot of bugs, Search/Query/Edit does not work, ...
    [Helmut, NN]

  - Create a mailing list for internal communication.
    [Monika]

  - Collect a complete list of all central output, reports, etc. like sow
    card, herd book, reports for organisations and farmers.
    [all, send them to Milena]

  - Define the different datastreams (DS), document the structures and put
    them into CVS into $APIIS_HOME/reference/doc.
    [all]

  - Get all the machine back on the internet after the workshop (mail,
    cvs), everybody should have his/her own email address for the mailing
    list.
    [all]

  - Preparations for the EU project.
    Define unique national topics in the context of this project.
    [all]

* 11. Jun 1999:
  Change i18n_apiis.pm from an array of hashes to a hash of hashes. This
  will make the code more readable ( msg('file_open') instead of msg(78) ).
