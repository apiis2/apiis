<p class="noindent">
     The administrator can not change his own access rights directly. The role definitions which are assigned to him can be changed 
     but the access rights views are not reloaded for him (they are reload for all other users which have these roles). 
     If the administrator want to do this he has to execute the following steps: <br>
     1. Change the role definitions which are assigned to him,<br>
     2. Create new administrator user with these new role definitions,<br>
     3. Login as new administrator,<br>
     4. Change the access rights of old administrator user or drop it from the database.

     <p class="noindent">If you have a problem with inserting new descriptors, then please open your log file and chek the error message. 
                         It can be that you will find there the following error mesage:<br>
                         <b>Error in SQL statement (system): DBD::Pg::st execute failed: ERROR: index row size 2884 exceeds btree maximum, 2713 
                         HINT: Values larger than 1/3 of a buffer page cannot be indexed. Consider a function index of an MD5 hash of the value, or use full text indexing</b>.<br> 
                         This means that the string which you are trying to insert in to the "descriptor value" field is to big. In such cas you can reduce your string or remove 
                         the index from the database. If you want to remove the index you have to execute the following actions from the command line:<br>
                          - psql database_name -U apiis_admin <br>
                          - DROP INDEX uidx_ar_dbtdescriptors_2;
